# Objective
* I want a function that doubles the value given to it
* That also returns nothing
* You're not allowed to re-assign the value of a
    * e.g. a = double( a ); Is not allowed

# Code

`c
/*
doubleThis(){

}
*/

int main(){
    int a = 10;

    //call doubleThis here

    cout << "A value : " << a << endl;

    return 0;
}

`

# Expected output
