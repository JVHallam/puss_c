# Notes
## High Prio:
* write a while loop out as a for loop and explain the similiarities,
    * Writing while loops
    * Then convert them to forloops
    * Write forloops
    * convert them to while loops

* needs to learn to use type declarations when declaring variables
* understanding that we have to declare the size of an array up front
* what does myArray[i] mean
* ( myArray + index ) makes no sense to luke
* void arrayMaker( int size ) vs void arrayMaker( int* size )
* More code examples with passing around int* to different functions
* Indexing the term and how to use it
* myArray[1] = 1; myArray[2] = 2; myArray[3] = 3; into a forloop

## Medium prio:
* how myArray[] is the same as int* myArray
* Remembering which braces to use for an array
* The order of execution of a forloop (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i);
* How to pass by value
* how to pass by reference
* the void return type vs the void* return type
* return types from functions, again

## Low prio:
* difference between "" and <> in include
* formatting printf strings
* Diagrams of stack vs heap
